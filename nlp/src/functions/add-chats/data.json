    "message": "Ownerships of private keys\n\nUnderstand that blockchain functions differently from bank accounts. An address on the blockchain is analogous to a traditional bank account. Each blockchain address is associated with a private key, which is analogous to your bank password. Whoever controls your private keys have ultimate control over your address and thereby your assets)\n\nWhen you keep your tokens in your own wallet, you have total control over your assets because you own your private keys. When you keep your tokens on an exchange, you are effectively keeping the tokens in the addresses that the exchange assigns you, and the exchange has total control over your assets because they are the ones who own the private keys to your addresses. \n\nCortex ERC20 vs. MainNet\n\nERC20 CTXCs are the Ethereum representation of CTXC, a temporary measure implemented before Cortex\u2019s MainNet launch in June, 2019. Transactions with ERC20 CTXCs occur on the Ethereum network. \n\nMainNet CTXCs are the \u201creal\u201d CTXCs. Transactions with MainNet CTXCs occur on the Cortex network. \n\nAs of now (November 15th, 2019), there are two types of CTXCs circulating in the market: ERC20 and Cortex MainNet tokens. Currently the four exchanges that have completed the token swap process and circulate Cortex MainNet tokens are: Binance, OKEX, BitForex and BitAsset. All other exchanges are still circulating ERC20 CTXCs, although major exchanges such as Huobi will very soon complete the token swap process for its users.\n\nTo ensure compatibility, the addresses and private keys for ERC20 and MainNet CTXCs are kept the same. This means: if you accidentally sent MainNet tokens to an address on an ERC20 exchange, it would not show up because the transaction occurred in the Cortex MainNet network, whereas the exchange only displays Ethereum transactions. Your tokens are not lost - they are just sent to the MainNet address, which is not displayed on the excahgnge. To access your MainNet tokens, you need to contact the exchange because they own your private keys and have total control over you assets.",

Once a wallet\u2019s status changes, e.g., \u201cInactive\u201d to \u201cNormal\u201d, that means that the wallet maintenance or issue has been resolved and the wallet is enabled for deposits and withdrawals.\n\nAll deposits or withdrawals made during maintenance will be executed after the maintenance work is finished.

To summarize, a lot of the markets that are currently offline for customers is because these tokens must first obtain a legal opinion from qualified Liechtenstein counsel stating that it is not a financial instrument, e-money, nor deposit under EU and Liechtenstein law. \n\nUntil these opinions have been obtained, we cannot open a token market for trading, and it will show on our platform as offline. We are displaying these offline markets because they were previously offered through Bittrex International. If a customer is a former Bittrex International customer with tokens in any offline markets, they can keep them in their account or withdraw them. \n\nHope this was useful!",

The Announcement. \n\nSome Bittrex Global users have recently experienced an issue whereby Cortex (CTXC) tokens were sent to mistaken addresses \u2013 resulting in the accidental misplacement of\u00a0mainnet CTXC tokens sent wrongly to Bittrex Global ERC20 address.\n\nTo rectify this situation, Bittrex Global and Cortex Foundation have reached an agreement to ensure users are compensated for lost funds, that were sent\u00a0prior the date of this announcement.\n\nThe Foundation will recover up to 150,000 CTXC tokens, so replacement coins can be issued to affected customers on a first-claim, first-served basis. We envisage that the 150,000 CTXC tokens should be sufficient to cover the losses users may have experienced.\n\nThe recovery and transfer will take place starting December 18th.\u00a0To make a claim and be eligible for compensation, customers should\u00a0submit a support ticket to Bittrex Global Zendesk by December 31, 2019:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nhttps://bittrexglobal.zendesk.com\u00a0\n\nBittrex Global Support will work with users to verify the loss.\u00a0\n\nThese are replacement coins and the mis-sent tokens will not themselves be recovered by Bittrex Global or any other party.\n\nFor more information, please contact customer service through the support link above.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe would like to thank the Cortex team for working closely with us.",

    "message": "Dear Cortex holders, pls see the post. \n\n\nBittrex Global is supporting Cortex (CTXC) as it transitions its blockchain from an Ethereum ERC20 token to a new mainnet token. On December 18, 2019 Bittrex Global will be doing a one time swap of our ERC20 tokens to their mainnet.\nAll CTXC users will retain the balance of their CTXC addresses, which will be migrated to the new Cortex blockchain. Bittrex Global users will need to generate new deposit addresses after the upgrade is complete.\nUsers\u2019 CTXC exchange balance totals will reflect the same total that they had prior to the swap in a 1:1 manner. Once the swap is complete, ERC20 CTXC tokens will no longer be supported or be traded on Bittrex Global.\nNote: All ERC20-based Cortex sent to Bittrex Global after the swap will not be recovered. Therefore, please do not send any ERC-20 based Cortex tokens to Bittrex Global after the swap on December 18. They will be unrecoverable and you will lose them.\nWallets will be closed for deposits and withdrawals at 5:00 PM UTC on December 18, 2019. If any ERC20 CTXC deposits you had sent to Bittrex Global are not settled by then (marked as pending), you may not be credited with CTXC. Any mainnet CTXC deposited to your address before this time cannot be processed or recovered. Bittrex Global will re-enable the CTXC wallet when we and the Cortex team agree that the migration is complete and satisfactory.\nSome Bittrex Global users have recently experienced an issue whereby Cortex (CTXC) tokens were sent to mistaken addresses \u2014 resulting in the accidental misplacement of mainnet CTXC tokens sent wrongly to Bittrex Global ERC20 address.\nTo rectify this situation, Bittrex Global and Cortex Foundation have reached an agreement to ensure users are compensated for lost funds, that were sent prior the date of this announcement.\nThe Foundation will recover up to 150,000 CTXC tokens, so replacement coins can be issued to affected customers on a first-claim, first-served basis. We envisage that the 150,000 CTXC tokens should be sufficient to cover the losses users may have experienced.\nThe recovery and transfer will take place starting December 18th. To make a claim and be eligible for compensation, customers should submit a support ticket to Bittrex Global Zendesk by December 31, 2019:\nhttps://bittrexglobal.zendesk.com\nBittrex Global Support will work with users to verify the loss.",

Users will need to generate new deposit addresses after the upgrade is complete.\n\nNote: All ERC20-based Cortex sent to Bittrex Global after the swap will not be recovered.\n\nUsers\u2019 CTXC exchange balance totals will reflect the same total that they had prior to the swap in a 1:1 manner. Once the swap is complete, ERC20 CTXC tokens will no longer be supported or be traded on Bittrex Global.\n\nWallets will be closed for deposits and withdrawals at 5:00 PM UTC on December 18, 2019. If any ERC20 CTXC deposits you had sent to Bittrex Global are not settled by then (marked as pending), you may not be credited with CTXC. \n\nAny mainnet CTXC deposited to your address before this time cannot be processed or recovered. \n\nBittrex Global will re-enable the CTXC wallet when we and the Cortex team agree that the migration is satisfactory.\n\nWe would like to thank the Cortex team for working closely with us.\n\n\nFull announcement: \nhttps://medium.com/@bittrexglobalteam/bittrex-global-support-for-the-cortex-ctxc-blockchain-upgrade-572051f87f80",

To summarize, a lot of the markets that are currently offline for customers is because these tokens must first obtain a legal opinion from qualified Liechtenstein counsel stating that it is not a financial instrument, e-money, nor deposit under EU and Liechtenstein law. \n\nUntil these opinions have been obtained, we cannot open a token market for trading, and it will show on our platform as offline. We are displaying these offline markets because they were previously offered through Bittrex International. If a customer is a former Bittrex International customer with tokens in any offline markets, they can keep them in their account or withdraw them. \n\nHope this was useful!",

To summarize, a lot of the markets that are currently offline for customers is because these tokens must first obtain a legal opinion from qualified Liechtenstein counsel stating that it is not a financial instrument, e-money, nor deposit under EU and Liechtenstein law. \n\nUntil these opinions have been obtained, we cannot open a token market for trading, and it will show on our platform as offline. We are displaying these offline markets because they were previously offered through Bittrex International. If a customer is a former Bittrex International customer with tokens in any offline markets, they can keep them in their account or withdraw them. \n\nHope this was useful!",

To summarize, a lot of the markets that are currently offline for customers is because these tokens must first obtain a legal opinion from qualified Liechtenstein counsel stating that it is not a financial instrument, e-money, nor deposit under EU and Liechtenstein law. \n\nUntil these opinions have been obtained, we cannot open a token market for trading, and it will show on our platform as offline. We are displaying these offline markets because they were previously offered through Bittrex International. If a customer is a former Bittrex International customer with tokens in any offline markets, they can keep them in their account or withdraw them. \n\nHope this was useful!",

We are the first crypto company in Europe to do this with them. We have continued to build on this relationship. As they have become more comfortable with crypto it has allowed us to improve our product offering. We hope in the near future to be able to offer seamless crypto conversion at the point of sale.

Our app will look for the best price across all the exchanges so the customer gets the best market price. Other solutions use an internal exchange and prices can be unfavourable\n2) All customer assets are held in 3rd party cold storage (BitGo) which has Lloyd\u2019s insurance up \u00a3100m. This gives peace of mind to our customers and there assets are safe.\n3) We aim to be regulated by GFSC in Jan next year. We already have in-principle approval which also adds peace of mind.\n\nThere are more features that we provide that other do not but those are the main ones. Our aim is to become the most trusted unified crypto banking solution",

    "message": "Suppose you have 0.1 BITCOIN on Bittrex with which you would like to buy ETH.\nNow you want to buy from the first sell order at ETH / BTC. However, this order is 0.12 BTC in size. Before, you could still buy from this order, so the order was reduced to 0.02 BTC and you could buy for 0.1 BTC.\nIt has been different for a long time. If the sell order you want to buy is larger than the amount you want to buy, then no transaction can be carried out.\n\nThe fact that many orders keep disappearing very quickly or getting bigger / smaller makes it impossible and complicated to buy.\nThat means you have to adjust the price for which you want to buy again and again. Until you do this, however, several orders disappear again, since the price adjustment was also changed. You now have to write down the number of bitcoins for which you want to buy, or use them with copy-paste. Before a click on your BTC number was enough and your purchase field was automatically filled with your total BTC number. That made it easier to adjust the amount.\n\nAbout 2 years ago your system was actually perfect in my opinion. However, now buying or selling on your exchange feels very slow and difficult since some months. I would be happy if you get it improved. In my opinion that is the most important thing in an exchange. Thanks \ud83d\ude07",

I also counted it manually and so it matches.  but the commission was set at 1.27USD and only after the transaction it was determined that another commission was taken in the amount of 0.002785.  this figure in the recalculation amounted to 23.797825 USD (which corresponds to +/- commission for transactions in 1 BTC).  which means that this transaction was not at a rate of 25%.  With this deal, 25% = 1.27USD.  BITTREX withdrew 23.797824 USD =?% According to the rules of the bid, BITTREX can change the conditions.

Our implementation of a Rewarded Video Module SDK for 90% of all online video platforms for publishers is unique and does not require any changes for the publisher workflow or changes to the viewers video platform preferences.
