I'm trying to work on setting up the repo, but I currently have no internet on my primary machine...\\nbut yea, it's fully free and truely OpenSource, to the point it's distributed with it's own python interpreters x86 for now, x64 will come, but I'm limiting the binaries to support WinXP, so no python 3.5 :\\nhow I started was just basic inspiration for wanting to convert Pichu from Melee, the project actually started as MAV, which never had a legit build everything was bruteforce\\nthen UMC v0.1 game along which used Tkinter with a custom ASCII.tmp format along with an external viewer built from an obj viewer in Tkinter...\\nthat's where I designed the basic functional data and formatting systems, it wasn't until 3.0 that things were upgraded to GLUT then SDL, then GLFW with a more effective data system and formatting interface.\\nand also where the idea of UGE was concieved and the newer class interface was started... it wasn't until recently that the classbased backend was actually implemented.\\nthe tools I've used were mainly for deciphering model formats, the best I have to rate being HexEdit Pro 4.0, which I had to hack out the annoying registration dialog\\nscreenshots:\\nlook near the bottom for the reasons I recommend HexEdit Pro\\nand then a slew of IDEs for python development, the best being VS2010PythonTools on WinXP until I ran into PyCharm for Linux which is better than EclipsePyTools\\nI need something with REAL intellisense, not just autocompletion that wasn't slow and had a working python console\\nwhat's nice about PyCharm is I can give it the IDLEbased syntax highlighting I used for SIDE\n"
